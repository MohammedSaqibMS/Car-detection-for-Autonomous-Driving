# ðŸš— Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

This repository implements a car detection system using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. The code demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and Keras to filter and visualize bounding boxes for detecting cars in an image.
